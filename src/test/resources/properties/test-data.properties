description-01=The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of \
  the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following \
  improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the \
  relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in \
  the code, and (ii) a \"gotchas\" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In \
  addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java \
  platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/\
  InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more \
  complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new \
  language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. \
  Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, \
  tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server \
  projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to \
  synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter \
  3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust \
  clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java \
  1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming \
  constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through \
  simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the \
  program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with \
  Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to \
  quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for \
  Java applications in networking technology.

description-02=With remarkable scope and in scrupulous detail, Professor Anderson analyzes the Indonesian revolution of \
  1945. Against the background of Javanese culture and the Japanese occupation, he explores the origins of the \
  revolutionary youth groups, the military, and the political parties to challenge conventional interpretations of \
  revolutionary movements in Asia. The author emphasizes that the critical role in the outbreak was played not by the \
  dissatisfied intellectuals or by an oppressed working class but by the youth of Indonesia. Perhaps most important are \
  the insights he offers into the conflict between strategies for seeking national revolution and those for attaining \
  social change. By giving first priority to gaining recognition of Indonesian sovereignty from the outside world, he \
  argues, the revolutionary leadership had to adopt conservative domestic policies that greatly reduced the possibility \
  of far-reaching social reform. This in-depth study of the independence crisis in Indonesia, brought back to life by \
  Equinox Publishing as the first title in it's Classic Indonesia series, also illuminates the revolutionary process in \
  other nations, where wars for independence have been fought but significant social and economic progress has not yet \
  been achieved. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Benedict Anderson is one of the world's leading authorities on South East Asian \
  nationalism and particularly on Indonesia. He is Professor of International Studies and Director of the Modern \
  Indonesia Project at Cornell University, New York. His other works include Imagined Communities: Reflections on the \
  Origin and Spread of Nationalism and The Spectre of Comparisons: Nationalism, Southeast Asia, and the World.
